# Fall 2025 Assignment 00: Getting Started

This is a test assignment to make sure GitHub classroom works for everyone.

See if you can clone the assignment, edit and run the `hello.py` script, and push the results up to your assignment repository.

Try doing this multiple ways to confirm you will have multiple development environment options to use for assignments in this class:
* (Mandatory) Open the repository in codespaces using the VS Code web interface
* (Mandatory) Clone the repository locally and run the script with your local Python environment
* (Optional for now) Clone the repository locally and open the codespace in a local container using Docker

Note that due to memory limitations, not all assignments will work well with codespaces. Codespaces is a convenient way for the class to have a common baseline environment, but will be limiting for more complex projects. Students **must** also know how to set up and maintain a local development environment for their preferred OS. Having Docker is not strictly required, but many students find it worth the extra setup time, especially for more complex projects later in the semester.
